# Smart Neighborhood Load Management System

## Overview

The Smart Neighborhood Load Management System is an intelligent energy coordination platform that monitors grid conditions in real-time and provides proactive alerts and recommendations to households when load consumption increases in their area. This system helps prevent power outages, reduces electricity costs, and promotes community-wide energy efficiency.

## Key Features

### 1. **Real-time Grid Load Monitoring**
- **Live Grid Status**: Monitors current grid load percentage, capacity, and status (Normal/High/Peak/Critical)
- **Area-based Tracking**: Tracks load conditions by geographic area codes (AREA_CENTRAL, AREA_NORTH, etc.)
- **Load Forecasting**: Provides 24-hour predictions of grid conditions
- **Peak Time Prediction**: Alerts users about upcoming peak demand periods

### 2. **Neighborhood Alert System**
- **Load Spike Detection**: Automatically detects sudden increases in area consumption (10-25% spikes)
- **Capacity Risk Alerts**: Critical warnings when grid approaches 90%+ capacity
- **Peak Load Warnings**: Notifications during high-demand periods (75%+ capacity)
- **Smart Timing Opportunities**: Alerts about optimal times for high-consumption activities

### 3. **Intelligent Load Shift Recommendations**
- **Appliance-Specific Guidance**: Targeted recommendations for high-consumption devices:
  - Air Conditioners (2.5 kWh avg) - High priority
  - Electric Ovens (2.0 kWh avg) - High priority
  - Water Heaters (1.8 kWh avg) - Medium priority
  - Clothes Dryers (1.5 kWh avg) - Medium priority
  - Washing Machines (1.2 kWh avg) - Medium priority
  - Dishwashers (1.0 kWh avg) - Low priority

- **Alternative Time Slots**: Suggests optimal off-peak windows:
  - Night: 11:00 PM - 6:00 AM
  - Midday: 10:00 AM - 3:00 PM

- **Cost Savings**: Calculates potential savings (up to 30% in off-peak hours)
- **Grid Impact**: Shows reduction in grid load (up to 80% impact reduction)

### 4. **Real-time Notification System**
- **Priority-based Alerts**: Critical > High > Medium > Low severity levels
- **Auto-refresh**: Updates every 30 seconds for real-time awareness
- **Dismissible Notifications**: Users can dismiss alerts they've seen
- **Community Impact**: Shows number of affected households and duration

## How It Works

### Grid Load Detection
```typescript
// Simulated realistic daily load patterns
const loadPattern = [
  30, 25, 22, 20, 18, 20, 25, 35, // 0-7 AM (night/early morning)
  45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, // 8-15 (morning/afternoon)  
  85, 90, 85, 75, 65, 55, 45, 35  // 16-23 (evening/night)
];
```

### Alert Generation Logic
1. **Critical Load (90%+)**: Immediate action required, risk of outages
2. **Peak Load (75-90%)**: High demand, encourage load shifting
3. **High Load (60-75%)**: Moderate concern, optional optimization
4. **Load Spikes**: 10%+ sudden increases trigger community alerts

### Smart Recommendations
The system analyzes:
- Current grid status and load percentage
- Time of day and predicted peak periods
- User's appliance inventory and usage patterns
- Potential cost savings and grid impact reduction

## User Interface Components

### 1. **Grid Status Dashboard** (`GridAwareness.tsx`)
- Live grid load percentage with color-coded status indicators
- Current area information and capacity utilization
- User impact score (0-100, lower is better for grid)
- Next predicted peak time

### 2. **Active Alerts Panel**
- Real-time neighborhood alerts with severity indicators
- Community impact metrics (affected households, duration)
- Integrated recommendations for immediate action

### 3. **Load Shift Recommendations**
- Appliance-specific suggestions with priority levels
- Cost savings and grid impact calculations
- Alternative time slot recommendations
- One-click "Apply" functionality for user commitment

### 4. **24-Hour Forecast**
- Hourly grid load predictions
- Color-coded status indicators for planning
- Optimal timing identification for high-consumption activities

### 5. **Real-time Notifications** (`GridNotifications.tsx`)
- Persistent top-of-page alerts
- Dismissible notification system
- Automatic refresh every 30 seconds
- Priority-based ordering

## Example Alert Messages

### Critical Load Alert
```
ðŸš¨ Critical Grid Load - Immediate Action Required
Grid capacity at 92.3%. Please immediately reduce non-essential appliance usage to prevent outages. 347 households affected.
```

### Load Spike Detection
```
ðŸ“ˆ Sudden Load Increase Detected  
A 18.2% load increase detected in your area (AREA_CENTRAL). Nearby households are increasing consumption. Consider delaying high-consumption activities like AC, water heating, or laundry.
```

### Smart Timing Opportunity
```
ðŸ’¡ Smart Timing Opportunity
Grid load is currently low (34.8%). Great time to run high-consumption appliances and save on electricity costs!
```
